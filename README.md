Please note:
This code does not include the control of a dfplayer for sound. 

Unfortunately, due to transferring data between several computers,  I am currently unable to find the ino file I used with sound control included.  

When it is eventually found or I get time to re-work the code to include the dfplayer I will upload it and the circuit diagram.   

This code will get you started.

I have included the sound file I used which is triggered when the hall effect sensor activates the code.
