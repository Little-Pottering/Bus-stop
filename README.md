Please note:
I have included a link to the code which controls the direction servo and stopping servo, it does not include the connection of a dfplayer for sound.  Unfortunately, due to changing computers several times,  I cannot find the ino file I used with sound included.  When it is eventually found or I get time to re-work the code to include the dfplayer I will upload it and the circuit diagram.
